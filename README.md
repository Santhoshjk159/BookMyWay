## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries Used  

### 1. **React**  
- React is the core framework used to build the web application's dynamic and interactive components.  
- React Router is used for seamless navigation between pages (`Home`, `About`, `Plan Trip`, `Contact`).  

### 2. **TailwindCSS**  
- TailwindCSS powers the styling of the application, providing responsive and modern designs with minimal effort.  
- Utility-first CSS ensures that the app is lightweight and easy to customize.  

### 3. **React Router DOM**  
- Allows for client-side routing and navigation between various sections of the application, like `Home`, `About`, `Plan Trip`, and `Contact`.  
- Smooth transitions between pages enhance user experience.  

### 4. **Free APIs**  
- **Unsplash API**: Used to fetch high-quality photos of destinations dynamically.  
- **Custom Pricing Logic**: The app simulates cost breakdowns for flights and hotels without needing a backend API.  

### 5. **JavaScript Libraries**  
- JavaScript is used for all dynamic logic, such as handling user inputs, calculating costs, and managing page navigation.
